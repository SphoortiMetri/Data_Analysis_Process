# Data_Analysis_Process: 

Data analysis is a crucial step when it comes to drawing inferences from any data.  It helps us in making informed decisions. 

This process can be divided into 5 steps. These steps are described briefly below: 

Step 1: Ask questions
Whether we are given the data first and formulate questions based on that, or we gather data after formulating questions, these questions help us stay focused on the features contributing to answering them.

Step 2: Wrangle data
This step is divided into 3 sub-steps. 
Gather: Collect data that helps in answering your questions 
Assess: Identifying any problems in your data’s quality or structure
Clean: modifying, replacing, or removing data to ensure that your dataset is of the highest quality and as well-structured as possible

Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis 
Exploring and augmenting your data to maximize the potential of your analyses, visualizations, and models. Exploring involves finding patterns in your data, visualizing relationships in your data, and building intuition about what you’re working with. After exploring, you can do things like remove outliers and create better features from your data, also known as feature engineering.

Step 4: Draw conclusions (or even make predictions)
This step is typically approached with machine learning or inferential statistics

Step 5: Communicate your results
You often need to justify and convey meaning in the insights you’ve found. Or, if your end goal is to build a system, you usually need to share what you’ve built, explain how you reached design decisions, and report how well it performs. There are many ways to communicate your results: reports, slide decks, blog posts, emails, presentations, or even conversations. Data visualization will always be very valuable.
